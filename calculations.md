# Calculations

total winning tickets * odds = total tickets
total tickets - total claimed winning tickets = current total
current total / remaining winning = current odds
remaining tickets from n prize category / current total = current odds for n prize category

# Example
15000 winning tickets
52500 total tickets
odds 1 in 3.5 
7000 remaining winning tickets
8000 claimed tickets
44500 current total
6.35 current odds
current total / 7 remaining jackpots = odds for jackpot
